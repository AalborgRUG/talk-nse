```r
x <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100)
plot(x, sin(x), type = "l")
```

???
To answer that, let's look at an example.  
Here is an R function which uses the _code_ given for its arguments in addition to their values

--

```{r plot-labels, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100)
plot(x, sin(x), type = "l")
```

???
Just a regular old plot using the base R `plot` function

--

How does `plot` know how to label the axes?

???
- I didn't pass any label-related arguments
- So where did these labels come from?
- Answer: **from the function arguments themselves**

Lets take a look under the hood of `plot.default`

Tip: inspect source code of function with

- `body(fun)`
- `fun` in console (without parentheses)
- In RStudio: place cursor in function name and press F2

As we can see from the argument list, you can pass axis labels explicitly, but you seemingly don't have to.

template: substitute

```r

???
These are the lines that produce the axis labels 

--

- `deparse`: turns unevaluated expressions into strings

???
- As the name implies, it does the opposite of parsing: expr -> string

--

- `substitute`: returns the *parse tree* for the expression

???
- Expression? But `x` and `y` are just numeric vectors, right?

# Promises


???
Wrong. `x` and `y` are _promises_

Here we come across one of the many reasons why I like R so much ― it reminds me of myself:

- It is _lazy_
- It makes _promises_ to evaluate your function arguments
- but it won't _actually_ do it, until it is absolutely necessary

What _is_ a promise?

From the R language definition:

- Promise objects are part of R’s lazy evaluation mechanism
- They contain three slots: a value, an expression, and an environment 
- When a function is called the arguments are matched and then each of the formal arguments is bound to a promise
- The expression that was given for that formal argument and a pointer to the environment the function was called from are stored in the promise

---

## Function arguments are lazy

```{r}
error_msg <- "Uh oh! You friccin moron. You just got BEANED!!!"

f <- function(arg) {
  print("Nothing to see here...")
}

f(stop(error_msg))
```

???
Here's an example of lazy evaluation in action:

- The function `f` takes an argument `arg`, but doesn't use it for anything
- Therefore, `arg` isn't ever evaluated, and we don't get an error

--

```{r, error=TRUE}
f <- function(arg) {
  arg
  print("Nothing to see here...")
}

f(stop(error_msg))
```

???
However, if the argument is used for _anything_, it forces evaluation, and we get an error

layout: true

## Calls are represented by abstract syntax trees (AST)

---

.pull-left[
```{r}
e1 <- quote(y <- 2 * x)
e2 <- quote(`<-`(y, `*`(2, x)))
identical(e1, e2)
```
]

???
Now we get to those aforementioned _abstract syntax trees_.

Here, we have the expression `y <- 2 * x`, which is _captured_ instead of evaluated via `quote()` (more on this later).  
Then we have another expression that may look different, but is actually the same.

---
count: false

.pull-left[
```{r}
e1 <- quote(y <- 2 * x)
e2 <- quote(`<-`(y, `*`(2, x)))
identical(e1, e2)
mode(e1)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
as.list(e1)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
as.list(e2)
```
]
]

???
What happens is that expressions are turned into _parse trees_ by the R interpreter, i.e. the structure it uses to evaluate the expression.  
`e2` is on so-called _standard form_, and when we type in `e1`, under the hood it gets turned into standard form.

`e1` is a `call` object in R, and if we break it into atoms, we see that it's represented exactly the same as `e2`.

Tip: in RStudio, type `View(e1)` to interactively and recursively browse the atoms of a call object **[show this]**

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(fig("simple-ast.svg"))
```
]

???
Here is a graphical representation of what's going on, called an _abstract syntax tree (AST)_.  

- The orange squares represent calls; first child is the function being called, subsequent children are arguments.

- Purple, rounded boxes represent symbols; symbols refer to R objects, it's what you type before `<-`, e.g. `y`

- Black boxes are syntactic literals; atomic values (logical, numeric, character, etc.)

## Everything is a call

???
Everything in the language is a call (or a symbol or a literal)

Looking at the values of these two expressions, they're obviously identical.  
They both simply evaluate to a numeric 1.

However, the expressions themselves are different from each other.

This is because everything in R (that isn't a symbol or literal) is a function, including all the delimiters.  
Parentheses and braces are `.Primitive` functions in R, and act as identity functions (with different printing rules).

.pull-left[
```{r}
identical(1, ({1}))
```
]

count: false

.pull-left[
```{r}
identical(1, ({1}))
e1 <- quote(1)
e2 <- quote(({1}))
identical(e1, e2)

count: false

.pull-left[
```{r}
identical(1, ({1}))
e1 <- quote(1)
e2 <- quote(({1}))
identical(e1, e2)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
typeof(e1)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
typeof(e2)
```
]
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='55%'}
knitr::include_graphics(fig("parens-ast.svg"))
```
]

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (i in 1:10) {
  i^2
}
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(fig("for-ast.svg"))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (x >= 0) {
  sqrt(x)
} else {
  0
}
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(fig("if-ast.svg"))
```
]

???
The same goes for more involved control structures.

Here are the ASTs for a simple `for` loop and an `if-else` block.  
They are no different than they would be for any other function;

- First child is the function name (`for`, `if`)

- Subsequent children are function arguments

  + looping variable, its range, and the expression to evaluate
  
  + condition, expression if `TRUE`, expression if `FALSE`

As an aside leading back to Lisp:  
Once you get the hang of ASTs, you basically know Lisp

In Emacs [Lisp Interaction]:

```lisp
(set 'y '(* 2 x))
(set 'x 4)
(eval y)
```

`C-u C-x C-e` to eval and insert value
