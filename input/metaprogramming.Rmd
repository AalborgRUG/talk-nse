# What is non-standard evaluation?

???
Let's jump right into the central question for this talk: what is NSE?

The quick answer is:

> Functions are said to use NSE when they evaluate one or more of their arguments in a non-standard way.

I don't suppose that really answers the question, though.  
Given this answer, what then is standard evaluation?

Another, slightly more informative way of putting it is that

> NSE is what we call it when functions use _metaprogramming_

I have titled this talk "Non-Standard Evaluation **and** Metaprogramming in R", but in truth, they aren't really seperate concepts.  
NSE seems to be a term originating from R circles, but metaprogramming is a paradigm that's certainly not exclusive to R.

So, [go to next slide]

# What is metaprogramming?

???

Answer: it's the ability to compute on the language itself

According to Wikipedia:

> Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat programs as their data. 
> It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.

Metaprogramming traces its roots back to the 1940s, where philosopher and logician Willard van Orman Quine introduces the concept of _quasiquotation_ as a linguistic device in formal languages (more on quasiquotation later)

The first programming language to support MP was Lisp in the 1970s.  
Some of you likely knows some Lisp, especially if you use Emacs.  
Lisp went **all in** on metaprogramming, making no distinction between code and data.

The computer scientist Paul Graham wrote in his essay "Revenge of the Nerds":

> _Lisp looks strange not so much because it has a strange syntax as because it has no syntax; you express programs directly in the parse trees that get built behind the scenes when other languages are parsed, and these trees are made of lists, which are Lisp data structures._

This is not a talk on Lisp, but R does inherit many ideas from Lisp, such as _parse trees_ and _lexical scoping_ both of which we'll see in a few slides.

# The structure of the R language

???
So let's dive into the meat of it all: how R works

Before we can compute on the language, we have to understand the language we want to compute on.

To quote Carl Sagan,

> _If you wish to make apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe_

So we ask ourselves: **how does R work?**
