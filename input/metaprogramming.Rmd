# What is metaprogramming?

???

Answer: it's the ability to compute on the language itself

According to Wikipedia:

> Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat programs as their data. 
> It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.

In R, this happens in many situations

---

```r
x <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100)
plot(x, sin(x), type = "l")
```

???
Here is an example in which an R function uses the _code_ given for its arguments in addition to their values

--

```{r plot-labels, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100)
plot(x, sin(x), type = "l")
```

???
Just a regular old plot using the base R `plot` function

--

How does `plot` know how to label the axes?

???
- I didn't pass any label-related arguments
- So where did these labels come from?
- Answer: **from the function arguments themselves**

Lets take a look under the hood of `plot.default`

Tip: inspect source code of function with

- `body(fun)`
- `fun` in console (without parentheses)
- In RStudio: place cursor in function name and press F2

As we can see from the argument list, you can pass axis labels explicitly, but you seemingly don't have to

```console

    log = "", main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, 
    ann = par("ann"), axes = TRUE, frame.plot = axes, panel.first = NULL, 
    panel.last = NULL, asp = NA, ...)

        deparse(substitute(y))  #<<

???
These are the lines that produce the axis labels 

--

- `deparse`: turns unevaluated expressions into strings

???
- As the name implies, it does the opposite of parsing: expr -> string

--

- `substitute`: returns the *parse tree* for the expression

???
- Expression? But `x` and `y` are just numeric vectors, right?

# Promises


???
- Wrong. `x` and `y` are _promises_
- R is _lazy_
  + It makes _promises_ to evaluate your function arguments
  + but it won't _actually_ do it, until it is absolutely necessary
- What _is_ a promise?
- From the R language definition:
  + Promise objects are part of Râ€™s lazy evaluation mechanism
  + They contain three slots: a value, an expression, and an environment 
  + When a function is called the arguments are matched and then each of the formal arguments is bound to a promise
  + The expression that was given for that formal argument and a pointer to the environment the function was called from are stored in the promise

## Function arguments are lazy

```{r}
error_msg <- "Uh oh! You friccin moron. You just got BEANED!!!"

f <- function(arg) {
  print("Nothing to see here...")
}

f(stop(error_msg))
```

???
Here's an example of lazy evaluation in action:

- The function `f` takes an argument `arg`, but doesn't use it for anything
- Therefore, `arg` isn't ever evaluated, and we don't get an error

--

```{r, error=TRUE}
f <- function(arg) {
  expr
  print("Looks like we made it")
}

f(stop(error_msg))
```

???
However, if the argument is used for _anything_, it forces evaluation, and we get an error

---

```{r}
e1 <- quote(y <- 2 * x)
e2 <- quote(`<-`(y, `*`(2, x)))
identical(e1, e2)
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(fig("simple-ast.svg"))
```

???
Here is a graphical representation of what's going on, called an _abstract syntax tree (AST)_.  
The orange squares represent calls; first child is the function being called, subsequent children are arguments.

```lisp
(setq y (* 2 x))
