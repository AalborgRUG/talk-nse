It's a question you ask yourself every time you develop an R package:

> Should I add a dependency that makes it easy or try to make it work with `base`?

- Base R does have some built-in capability of non-standard evaluation (`quote`, `substitute`, etc.)
- But I will use `rlang` (from the `tidyverse` suite), because:
  + it's recent
  + it's consistent
  + it plays very well with other `tidyverse` packages
