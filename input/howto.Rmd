## The rlang package

```{r}
# install.packages("rlang")
library(rlang)
```

.pull-left[
### Pros

- Consistent

- Good with `tidyverse`
]

.pull-right[
### Cons

- Another dependency
]

???
It's a question you ask yourself every time you develop an R package:

> Should I add a dependency that makes it easy or try to make it work with `base`?

- Base R does have some built-in capability of non-standard evaluation (`quote`, `substitute`, etc.)
- But I will use `rlang` (from the `tidyverse` suite), because:
  + it's recent
  + it's consistent
  + it plays very well with other `tidyverse` packages

## Quasiquotation

???
We return to Orman Quine's concept of _quasiquotation_, which plays a central role in metaprogramming.

There are two sides to quasiquatation:

- Quotation
- Unquotation

Quotation is the act of capturing an unevaluated expression.

Capturing the AST of an expression associated with an argument is the core of NSE.  
`rlang` provides several functions for this task:

`expr`/`exprs`, in Hadley's own terminology, capture the _developer's_ expressions.  
This means that the literal code you type between the parentheses is what is quoted;
using it to quote an argument inside a function will return the argument name.

```

]

]

Most of the time, we probably don't want to quote our own input, but our users' instead.

`enexpr`/`enexprs` capture the _user's_ expressions.  
This means that it captures the expression associated with a function argument _as the user supplied it_ instead of how you, the developer, coded it.

.pull-right[

]

]

???
As I mentioned in the pros of `rlang`, it's syntactically consistent, and many functions exists in plural and en-prefixed variants

These functions differ from `[en]expr[s]` in that their arguments must correspond to symbols, atoms of expressions, rather than whole expressions.

`sym`/`syms` are for turning strings into quoted symbols; useful for `tidyverse` programming (we'll get to that later)

`ensym`/`ensyms` perhaps takes a little more explaining: they check that the captured expression is _either_ a string or a symbol

- If string: converts to symbol
- If symbol: leaves as symbol
- Error otherwise

.left-column[
### Quotation
]

.right-column[
- .rb[`quo()`], .rb[`quos()`] : like `expr[s]`, but also captures the current environment
- .rb[`enquo()`], .rb[`enquos()`] : like `enexpr[s]`, but also captures the calling environment

```{r}
f <- function() {
  foo <- 10
  quo(foo * 2)
}
f()
```

]

???
Quosures (quote + closure) form the basis of the so-called _tidy evaluation_ framework (which we'll get to in a second).  
They are implemented as a subclass of onesided formulas.

Quosures expand on the "regular" quoting functions by not only capturing expressions, but also their context, i.e. the environments from which they came.

The example shown here is not very interesting until we get to [Evaluation](#evaluation).

.left-column[
### Quotation

### Unquotation
]

.right-column[
- .rb[`!!`]  : (unquote) unquotes its argument (single expression)
- .rb[`!!!`] : (unquote-splice) unquotes and splices its argument (list of expressions)

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- expr(a + b + c)
expr(f(!!x, y))
xs <- exprs(a + b, c + d)
expr(f(!!!xs))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  x <- enexpr(x)
  expr(!!x + y)
}
f(my_var)
```

]

]

???
Unquotation is related to evaluation, but with an important distinction:  
Unquoting lets us selectively evaluate parts of a quoted expression.
Using this technique, we can form complex ASTs from simpler expressions.

To put it simply, the unquote and unquote-splice _replace_ nodes in the ASTs.

In Lisp:

```lisp
(set 'snue '(bar baz))

`(foo ,snue)
;;> (foo (bar baz))

`(foo ,@snue) 
;;> (foo bar baz)
```

## Evaluation

???
Typically, you quote code because you want to either do something with the AST, run the code in another context, or (often) both.

--

- .rb[`eval_bare()`] or simply .rb[`base::eval()`] : evaluate quoted expression
- .rb[`eval_tidy()`] : evaluate quosure

???
`rlang` provides 

- `eval_bare` as a lower-level version of `base::eval`, which just evaluate their argument, optionally specifying an environment
- `eval_tidy` for evaluation the special quosures, who as we saw "remember" the environment in which they were defined

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
foo <- 5
f1 <- function() {
  foo <- 10
  expr(foo * 2)
}
my_expr <- f1()
my_expr
eval_bare(my_expr)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
foo <- 5
f2 <- function() {
  foo <- 10
  quo(foo * 2)
}
my_quo <- f2()
my_quo
eval_tidy(my_quo)
```

]

???
These examples show the difference between regular evaluation and tidy evaluation.

In the `expr` example to the left, `my_expr` only carries with it information about the expression it represent, and not its context.  
As such, when we evaluate it, the looks up symbols in the current environment, here the global environment, and finds `foo = 5`.

In the `quo` example, however, `my_quo` additionally includes the context from its creation, i.e. the _execution_ environment.  
It therefore finds `foo = 10` from within the scope of `f2` and uses that, even though we also have `foo` in the global environment.
