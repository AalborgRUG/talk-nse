## Programming with tidyverse

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE)
library(rlang)
```

???
NSE is almost synonymous with `tidyverse`, and I'd wager it's where most of us first hears about it.

It's a common problem when you want to program with `tidyverse` packages:  
they are made for interactive use and uses NSE for syntactic convenience.  
This makes life difficult for us as developers, however.

- Previously, `tidyverse` functions came in two variants: the regular, and an "underscored" one, where the latter used SE
- This is no longer the case (the underscored functions were deprecated when the ideas of `rlang` were put into place)
- Instead, we use the `rlang` functions I've covered with the regular functions

Instead of having special functions that take strings instead of expressions, we provide the arguments as expressions using quasiquotation.

For me, personally, I often saw this during my time as a student assistant at NEAS;  

- Many of my tasks involved creating interactive analytics dashboards with Shiny
- These would in some way did some data analysis based on user inputs
- Back then, however, all the things I've been talking about were developing ideas, and I had enough on my plate just learning how to wrangle data, so I never got to _actually_ use these techniques
- But it serves as a prime example of a situation in which it makes sense

Let's take a look at some scenarios you might find yourself in when programming with `tidyverse`.

---

### Scenario: interactive end user function

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_count <- function(data, group_var) {
  data %>% 
    group_by(group_var) %>% 
    tally()
}

my_count(iris, Species)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
my_count <- function(data, group_var) data %>% group_by(group_var) %>% tally()
error_print(my_count(iris, Species))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
my_count2 <- function(data, group_var) {
  group_var <- enexpr(group_var)
  data %>% 
    group_by(!!group_var) %>% 
    tally()
}

my_count2(iris, Species)
```
]

???
## Scenario
You want to write a function that mimics the style of `tidyverse` functions, i.e. it lets the user type in `group_var` as-is.  
Supplying `group_var` as-is to `group_by` makes it look for a column literally named `group_var`.

## Solution
Quote `group_var` and unquote it in the context where it's used
---

### Scenario: variable selection in e.g. a Shiny app

.pull-left[
```{r}
my_select1 <- function(data, vars) {
  data %>% 
    select(vars)
}

df <- tibble(x = 1:5, y = 6:10, 
             vars = letters[1:5])
my_vars <- c("x", "y")

my_select1(df, my_vars)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
my_select2 <- function(data, vars) {
  vars <- ensyms(vars)
  data %>% 
    select(!!!vars)
}

my_select2(df, my_vars)
```
]

???
## Scenario
You want to let your users use `dplyr::select` in a Shiny app, where they can pick variables from e.g. a `selectInput`.  
While `select` _can_ be used with string vectors, you run into trouble if a column in the data has the same name as the vector (contrived, I know).

## Solution
Turn the vector of strings into a list of symbols with `ensyms` and unquote-splice inside `select`.

---

### Scenario: end user function involving variable assignment 

.pull-left[
```{r, error=TRUE}
my_adder1 <- function(data, col1, col2, newcol) {
  col1 <- ensym(col1)
  col2 <- ensym(col2)
  newcol <- ensym(newcol)
  data %>% 
    mutate(!!newcol = !!col1 + !!col2)
}

my_adder1(df, x, y, z)
```

- .rb[`:=`] : (colon-equals) definition operator that supports unquoting on both the LHS and RHS
]

.pull-right[
```{r, error=TRUE}
my_adder2 <- function(data, col1, col2, newcol) {
  col1 <- ensym(col1)
  col2 <- ensym(col2)
  newcol <- ensym(newcol)
  data %>% 
    mutate(!!newcol := !!col1 + !!col2)
}

my_adder2(df, x, y, z)
```
]

???
## Scenario
You want to make an interactive function, `tidyverse` style, that lets the user select two columns to add together to a new column, and set a name for it.  
However, the code `newcol = !!col1 + col2` results in a new column that's always named `newcol`, and unquoting it is invalid syntax.

## Solution
Use the special colon-equals operator, `:=`
